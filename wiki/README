Release: v0.1
Discription: Script used to pull up arch wiki pages quickly from the terminal.

NOTE:
For this script to work it requires lynx as a dependency.

pacman -S lynx

HOW TO USE:
The simplest way to use my script is to copy wiki.sh to your path. Copy the script
to ~/bin or /usr/local/bin note you will likely need sudo privelege to write 
to /usr/local/bin. Also note when copying to path don't include the .sh filename,
this way the command you run will be wiki, not wiki.sh.

example:
sudo cp wiki.sh /usr/local/bin/wiki

Once you have copied the script to your path you can simply run wiki from anywhere
on the command line to pull up the arch wiki. To search pass an option to your command

example:
wiki ssh
wiki apache
wiki grub

This will pull up your search on the arch wiki and display it to you in lynx
Enjoy this program, will update frequently.
